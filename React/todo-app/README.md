## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
  - Stateful and stateless components
  - `useState`, `useEffect` hooks
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)

### What I learned

- Using styled-components in React JS
  - Writing global styles using `createGlobalStyle`
  - Using `keyframes` and `css` keywords
  - Using `attrs` (although not present in this project)
  - Passing props
  - Extending styles
- Advanced CSS
  - Transitioning background image and svg images
  - Creating a border with gradient color background
- Using a drag-and-drop external library
- Parsing data from json file
- Saving data in local storage

### Continued development

I am a big animation freak, so in the future, I plan to learn Frame Motion in the hope that it will make my life easier.
