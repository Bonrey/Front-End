## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first React challenge. That's why I picked an easy page. Anyway, I learned quite a lot of stuff.
Especially, about React:

- First of all, setting up a react project
  - Using npm
  - Working with package.json
  - Structuring a react-app project
- Working with Functional and Class components
- Using State and Props to dynamically update UI elements
- Using SASS with React

### Continued development

Now, I'll try to create some more complex projects with React.

### Useful resources

- [React official site](https://reactjs.org/) - An amazing site with clear-cut explanations and a comprehensive React tutorial
- [W3School (React)](https://www.w3schools.com/react/) - Although many people disapprove of this site, I still find it very helpful at times
- [FreeCodeCamp (React)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react) - A very comprehensive React tutorial
