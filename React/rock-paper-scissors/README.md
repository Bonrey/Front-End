## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion)

### What I learned

- Building cool animations using Framer Motion
- Deepening my understanding of styled-components
  - Using `attrs` for default html attributes
- The use of the dependency array in `useEffect` hook

### Continued development

- I'd love to learn some other React libraries and deepen my understanding of those I already tried out.
- I want to get rid of the image flickering on the first launch. Probably there's some preloading technique or something. I want to investigate it!
